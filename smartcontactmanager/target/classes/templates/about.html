    <p class="text-muted">
        Smart Contact Manager is a modern web-based application designed to
        help users manage their contacts in a secure and organized way.
        It provides a digital solution for storing personal and professional
        contact details without relying on traditional methods.
    </p>

    <p>
        In many cases, contacts are stored across multiple devices or platforms,
        which makes them difficult to manage and maintain. Smart Contact Manager
        solves this problem by offering a centralized system where users can
        store all their contacts in one place and access them whenever needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application focuses on simplicity, security, and usability.
        Each user has a personal account protected by authentication,
        ensuring that contact information remains private and secure.
        Users can easily add new contacts, update existing information,
        or remove contacts that are no longer required.

    <h4>Purpose of the Project</h4>

    <p>
        The primary purpose of Smart Contact Manager is to reduce manual
        effort in managing contact information and to provide a reliable
        platform for storing data digitally. It is especially useful for
        individuals who handle a large number of contacts in their daily
        personal or professional activities.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project also demonstrates the practical implementation of
        modern web technologies such as Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and
        database integration. It follows a structured approach to
        web application development with proper separation of concerns.

    <h4>Technology Overview</h4>

    <p>
        Smart Contact Manager is developed using Spring Boot for backend
        processing and business logic, while Thymeleaf is used for
        server-side rendering of dynamic web pages. The frontend is built
        using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and
        user-friendly interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application uses a relational database to store user and
        contact information securely. Authentication and authorization
        mechanisms are implemented to ensure that only registered users
        can access and manage their contacts.
    </p>
